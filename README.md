## 🧠 System Overview

This robot continuously reads its tilt using an MPU6050 sensor and adjusts the speed and direction of its motors to maintain upright balance. It uses a closed-loop PID control system:

- **Kp (Proportional):** 40.0
- **Ki (Integral):** 180.0
- **Kd (Derivative):** 2.0

## 💻 Software & Libraries

This project is developed using the **Arduino IDE**.

### Libraries Used:

- `Adafruit_MPU6050`
- `Adafruit Unified Sensor`
- `Wire` (standard)

Install them using:  
**Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries...**

## ⚙️ Setup and Operation

1. Assemble the robot hardware according to the wiring diagram.
2. Open the `balance_controller.ino` sketch in the Arduino IDE.
3. Select board: **ESP8266 Dev Module**.
4. Upload the sketch to your NodeMCU.
5. Calibrate the robot to maintain vertical postion by tuning the PID values.
6. Disconnect USB and power the board via batteries.
7. Carefully place the robot upright and gently let go.

---

## 🎯 Setpoint Calibration

In the code, you'll find:

```cpp
float setpoint = 0.35;
```

This is the **target pitch angle** the robot aims to maintain. You may slightly adjust this value depending on your robot’s physical center of mass. You can find this value by running `setpoint_calc.ino`.

## 🎛️ PID Tuning

No need to re-upload code — **PID gains can be updated via the Serial Monitor**.

### 📟 How to Tune

1. Connect the robot to your PC via **USB**.
2. Open **Serial Monitor** at `115200 baud`.
3. Type commands like:
   - `p45.5` → Sets **Kp** = 45.5
   - `i200` → Sets **Ki** = 200
   - `d1.8` → Sets **Kd** = 1.8
4. Observe the robot's behavior and tune for:
   - Minimal oscillation
   - Stable balance
